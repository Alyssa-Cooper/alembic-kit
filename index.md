I started this blog as a way to capture my journey of habit building, living a sustainable life, and mindfulness. What's on my mind right now:

* I'm currently writing a fantasy novel ~ 2 chapters in
* Books: Atomic Habits, The Eye of the World, and Harrow the Ninth
* Habit: 10 minute morning yoga
* Life fix: Phone usage to 1 hour or less a day
