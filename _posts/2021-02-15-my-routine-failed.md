Three weeks ago I was meditating for five minutes a day, working out four days a week, keeping my phone usage to less than two hours a day, and devouring books. Now, my screen time is back up, I haven't meditated in weeks, and the last time I worked out was last Thursday. I'm still reading though my time spent doing so has decreased.

Habits are fickle. I recognize that and I often find myself going strong for a few weeks before I fall off the saddle. A few weeks ago I [blogged about my twenty-minute morning routine](https://medium.com/@alyssa_cooper/how-20-minutes-a-day-changed-my-life-fd71a3285b74) that was making a profound impact on my life. I was happier, healthier, and full of energy and focus. As much as I enjoyed the effects of that routine, I fell off. Here is why my routine failed and how I'm getting back on track.

**Part I: The Mighty Fall of My Habits**

For me to complete my morning routine, I had to wake up twenty minutes earlier every morning. That was not a problem until I fell back into my old "bad" habit of staying up late. When I stay up late it means falling asleep around 1:30 am. Falling asleep later led me to get roughly six hours of sleep. Therefore, my sleep was suffering. Suddenly, that twenty minutes of morning routine seemed more like an inconvenience than a benefit. All I wanted was to catch up on sleep and I resorted to sleeping in and slowly cutting parts of my routine into until it was nonexistent. I was getting up at 8 am, making coffee, and jumping into my desk chair for work without a second to breathe.

I tried to fall asleep earlier and because I couldn't shut my brain off long enough to focus on reading, I turned back to using my phone. My phone usage skyrocketed because I was falling asleep while scrolling on Reddit. 

The decline of sleep led to a lack of time in the morning for my routine. My morning ritual provided me mental clarity. It was my time to breathe, journal, and prep myself for the day ahead. When I didn't have time for this clarity I lacked focus, became more irritable, and relied on social media for a pick-me-up. I know that this lifestyle isn't sustainable for me. I'm at my best when my mind is clear and my body is properly cared for. So I'm bringing back my routine with some modifications to get back into my habits.

**Part II: The Resurgence**

I need to set-up a routine for myself that works. I loved my last one but I watched it crumble. So for this round, I'm using a few different methods. For starters, I'm keeping the core components:

- Wake up and avoid phone usage
- Chug water
- Bathroom
- Meditation (Modification: Two minutes rather than 5)
- ~~Journal~~ Write
- *New:* Stretching **(replacing Yoga)
- *New:* Planks, sit-ups, push-ups, lunges
- Coffee

I find that most mornings I don't have much I care to journal about. So I changed the journaling component to writing. Rather than journaling my thoughts, I'm going to write at least one line every morning, just a single line. It can be a thought, a sentence in the fantasy novel I'm writing, a hope, a dream, my coffee recipe, it's just got to be a single line. In Atomic Habits, James Clear talks about the *Two Minute Rule.* The Two Minute rule decreases the friction of beginning a habit by starting with a low time commitment. Just do your habit for a short period to get started and eventually you'll stick with it and can work on expanding it later. An example Clear provided was running a marathon. Want to run a marathon? Start by running for two minutes every day. One day, bump it up to five, then ten, and so on. You'll already be on the run so there is no barrier to increasing the time. I'm applying this rule to writing. I enjoy writing but sometimes I lack the motivation to sit down and do it. Writing one sentence will help me complete my habit while also helping me work through the days where I feel like skipping it.

I'll also be applying the two-minute rule to meditation, stretching, and my mini-workout. Eventually, I'll apply it to running when the ice outside dissipates.

My morning routine has been modified to be less intimidating and easier to accomplish. I also shaved off roughly ~6 minutes.

**Part III: Nighty Night Cooper**

As much as I love my morning routine, I recognize that having a wind-down process is just as crucial. Winding down each night can lead to better sleep. And being someone who *loves* sleep (I would sleep for 12 hours a day if I could), I need the highest quality sleep I can get to feel rested and restored. I'm establishing a set of rules for myself to be sure I'm getting enough sleep and falling asleep with less hindrance.

What I'm Doing:

- No food after 7:30 pm
- Putting a hard stop on phone usage at 9 pm and computer usage by 10 pm
- At least 2 minutes of both meditation and journaling
- Reading
- In bed by 11 pm

With these rules, I'm trying to accomplish a few things:

- Meditation + journaling: relaxing my brain before bed and getting out any thoughts that might hinder my sleep
- Restricting eating window: Reduce feeling bogged down before bed, healthier eating habits
- Technology cut-off: Reduce blue light emission, staying away from social media, healthier relationship with technology

I'm not sure if these new tricks will work, but I think they are worth trying. I'll report back if these changes have helped me, if I've made any modifications, or if I have scrapped this routine entirely. For now, I want to focus on getting better with my everyday routines and habits.
